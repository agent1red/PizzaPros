        <p>
            The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
            exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
            and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
            authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
            the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
            scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
            of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
            works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
            and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
            These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
            culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
            works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
            part through the use and efforts of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
            expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
            associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
            is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
            elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
            terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
            Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

                Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
                of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
                irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
                Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
                of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
                future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
                worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
                treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
                purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
                member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
                successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
                revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
                equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public

                Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
                account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
                extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
                person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
                irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
                Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the

                limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
                "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
                applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
                reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
                partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
                of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
                will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
                Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
                action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
